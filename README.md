# Garage A Parking Checker
**Uses code from [Unofficial UCF Parking API.](https://github.com/ctcuff/UCFParking-Web)**

## How it works

First it scrapes data from the UCF parking website. Then it parses that data for the information it needs and writes it to my Firebase database.

This is done automatically every hour, and can be done manually by going to the ![backend's website](https://garage-a-checker.herokuapp.com/).

## How to view the information

Go to https://isgarageafull.com

This is the front end of my website. ![View the code here](https://github.com/Goff-Davis/garage-a-checker-frontend/tree/develop)

## Why build this

I wanted to practice interacting with Google Firebase and Heroku with python, so I built a silly project around it.
